Programming Language: Python or C++ for custom scripts.

System Design

1. Hardware Architecture

The hardware setup consists of:

LiDAR Sensor: Mounted on the drone to provide a 360° view of the surroundings.

Flight Controller: Manages the drone’s flight dynamics and integrates obstacle avoidance commands.

Companion Computer: Processes data from the LiDAR and runs navigation and mapping algorithms.

Power Supply: Ensures both the drone and the LiDAR sensor receive sufficient power.

2. Software Architecture

Obstacle Avoidance:

The LiDAR sensor continuously scans the environment for obstacles.

Distance and angle data are processed to detect objects within a defined safety threshold.

Commands are sent to the flight controller to adjust the drone’s path and avoid collisions.

Environment Mapping:

The drone generates a 2D/3D map of the environment using LiDAR data.

ROS processes the data and visualizes it in RViz.
